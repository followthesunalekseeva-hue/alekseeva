# Hello

my name is Anna
I live by the sea.
Every morning, the salty breeze finds its way through my window, gently waking me up. It's my favorite alarm clock.
The beach is never truly empty here — it's always filled with the laughter of seagulls.

Winter is when the magic truly happens.

When the air turns crisp and cold, beautiful white swans arrive with quiet dignity, gliding gracefully across the water.
Flocks of ducks join them, splashing and playing, turning the calm winter sea into a lively gathering place.
I love watching them — the swans so elegant and peaceful, the ducks so cheerful and busy.

Walking along the shore in winter, wrapped in my warm coat, watching these beautiful birds — it feels like my own little fairytale.

This is my home. This is my happy place. Just me, the sea, and my feathered friends.
